I am a systems engineer who loves to create new things, learn at every opportunity and innovate with technology that is born daily. I am very interested in everything related to cybersecurity, backend and frontend application development. If I see that I can help others to solve any doubt they have in their projects, I will do it without any qualms, as long as I have the necessary knowledge to reach the required solution.
